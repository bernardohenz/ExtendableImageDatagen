# ExtendableImageDatagen
Implementation of a Keras data-generator that allows setting up a pipeline of transformations. It also works with many works and with multiprocessing on fit/evaluate.

Test files compare the runs using (or not) shuffle, using 1 or 8 workers, and using (or not) multiprocessing.
